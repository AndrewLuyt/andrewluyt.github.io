## [Data analytics: Chicago's Divvy Bikeshare](https://andrewluyt.github.io/divvy-bikeshare/)
Traffic patterns are visualized and the differences between *Divvy* members and casual users are explored.

## [Evidence for social unrest in a bicycle use dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andyinverted/evidence-for-social-unrest-in-bicycle-usage-data)
