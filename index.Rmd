I'm a data analyst in Vancouver, Canada, and these are my public projects.

## [1. Data analytics: Chicago's Divvy Bikeshare](https://andrewluyt.github.io/divvy-bikeshare/)
**Using a dataset of over four million bicycle rides,** traffic volume and flow patterns are visualized, and the differences between yearly members and casual users are explored.

## [2. Destructive Weather Events, 1950-2011](https://rpubs.com/agl/852813)
**Extensive data cleaning** of an old NOAA dataset is required to discover the
most costly types of weather events in the USA, in terms of human and financial 
damage. Done as a final project in the Johns Hopkins course *Reproducible Research.*

## [3. Evidence for social unrest in a bicycle use dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andyinverted/evidence-for-social-unrest-in-bicycle-usage-data)
**Exploratory visual data analysis** of the *Divvy* dataset leads to a surprising signal hiding in the data. *Hosted on Kaggle.com as a notebook.*
