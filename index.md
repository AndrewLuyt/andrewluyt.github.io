I’m a data analyst in Vancouver, Canada, and these are my public
projects. The image below is a visualization of bicycle traffic flow in
Chicago’s *Divvy* bike sharing service.

## [Data analytics: Chicago’s Divvy Bikeshare](https://andrewluyt.github.io/divvy-bikeshare/)

Traffic patterns are visualized and the differences between *Divvy*
members and casual users are explored.

## [Evidence for social unrest in a bicycle use dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andyinverted/evidence-for-social-unrest-in-bicycle-usage-data)

Exploratory data analysis of the *Divvy* dataset leads to a surprising
signal hiding in the data. *Hosted on Kaggle as a notebook.*
